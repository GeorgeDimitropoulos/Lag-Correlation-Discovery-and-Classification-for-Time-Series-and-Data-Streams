The high volume of data in dynamic places such as financial markets necessitates the implementation of effective mining methods to aid
investors towards profitable decision making. The mining problems that are studied in this paper are lag correlation discovery and
classification. Regarding the first, a new lag correlation algorithm for time series is proposed in this paper which is called
Highly Sparse Lag Correlation (HSLC) and it is a combination of Boolean Lag Correlation (BLC) and Hierarchical Boolean Representation (HBR)
algorithms. It aims to improve the time performance of Pearson Lag Correlation (PLC) algorithm. The classification algorithm that is
employed is an incremental support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed
schemes, the lag correlation discovery algorithm is experimentally tested on electroencephalography (EEG) data that measures the electric
activity of the brain, whereas the classification algorithm is tested on real financial databases. The HSLC algorithm that we propose,
achieves better time performance over previous state-of-the-art methods such as the PLC algorithm and the incremental SVM learning
algorithm that we adopt, increases the accuracy achieved by non-incremental models.
